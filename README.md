# qr_scanner

A new Flutter project that can generate a QR code and likewise scan a QR code.

## Getting Started

This is just a simple project that implements the scanning of QR codes and generating of QR codes. 


We have a Tab menu that separates the QR code from the scanner.


The scanner also displays the value of the bar code.

The QR code generates a new code when a button is clicked.
